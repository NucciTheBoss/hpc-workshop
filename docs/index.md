# Welcome to NucciTheBoss's HPC workshop!

If you are here for the workshop __The open-source software behind High-Performance Computing__, then you are in the 
right place! I am excited to give you an introduction to the open-source software that powers HPC on Ubuntu at the 2022 
Ubuntu Summit in Prague.

## Forword

While this workshop is set at the intermediate level, this workshop provides a beginner-friendly introduction to the 
open-source software behind HPC on Ubuntu. The reason this workshop is set to intermediate the level is because I 
expect you to be very comfortable working from the terminal on Ubuntu. If you are not familiar with executing complex 
bash commands, editing files, and/or managing multiple sessions from the terminal, then you may struggle with this 
workshop. I will be focusing on teaching folks how to build a pseudo-HPC cluster, not how to copy and paste text 
from the terminal. __However__, I was once a beginner too, so I will not be mean and stupid by leaving you in the dust. 
If you do not know how to do something and we have extra time, please call me over.

I expect that you have a decent CPU, at least 4 cores, and at least 8 GB of RAM in your machine. You might be able to 
get away with lower specs, but things may take longer to "finish." If your machine is struggling to keep up, try pairing
with another individual and working together with them. I respect potatoes with a CPU, but there are just some things 
that they are not very good at...

__Now let us get on with the show!__
