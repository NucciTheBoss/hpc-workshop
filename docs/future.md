# What now?

Congratulations! You have successfully built yourself a micro-HPC cluster. You might be asking yourself "where to next?"
If you are interested in learning more about HPC in general on Ubuntu, feel free to check out our blog on the
Ubuntu website:

If you are interested in learning more about how Canonical is involved in the HPC industry, you can check out our

If you are just interested in playing around with your cluster more, have a field day. You can do a lot of cool things
on HPC clusters!

__Thank you for working through my workshop and I will see you again soon!__
